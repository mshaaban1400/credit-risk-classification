# Credit Risk Report

### Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this credit risk analysis was to test how well this model can predict whether a loan is healthy or high-risk. The financial data tested in this analysis included loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt to income, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status. With this information, I attempted to predict whether someone would be able to pay the desired loan amount back based on the interest rate and the applicant's current assets. I used Train Test Split to evaluate the machine learning algorithm and then performed a logistic regression analysis.

### Results
Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

* ***Accuracy score:*** This value produced by the analysis of the model's capabilities tells us how well the model predicts true positives and negatives out of the total predictions. This model accurately predicted 99% of the total predictions. 
* ***Precision score:*** This value tells us how accurately the model predicts true positives by determining the proportion of true positives to false positives.
* ***Recall score:*** This value tells us the proportion of accurately predicted positives to the number of true positives.

### Conclusion 

With a 1% error rate, the model shows it can predict whether applicants are fit based on the accuracy of a real banker's ability to determine whether an applicant is fit for a loan. While the model still have some flaws, for an example the relative identification of a true positive of 84% of total positives, the model seems to have a good accuracy. I recommend the model.
